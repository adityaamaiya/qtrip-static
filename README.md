About this project- 
I have made Qtrip- a travel website using HTML and CSS Fundamentals. 
QTrip is a travel website where users can browse the various Adventures on offer, based on their places of interest and book an Adventure.

They can navigate between the pages by clicking on the cards and using the navigation bar.
The website can also be viewed on other devices such as smartphones and tablets.

QTrip website have these 3 pages-

Landing Page - This is the starting page for the website. It lists the various cities for which you can explore adventures.
Adventures Grid Page - This is the page that you’ll get to by clicking on one of the city cards on the Landing Page. It lists the Adventures available for that city.
Adventure Details Page - This is the page that you’ll get to by clicking on one of the Adventures on the Adventures Grid Page. It lists details about that particular Adventure.
